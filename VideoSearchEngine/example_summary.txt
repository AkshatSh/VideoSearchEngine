Police in Colorado are looking for a mystery jogger - dubbed "the Mad Pooper" - who keeps defecating outside a family's home.
Cathy Budde says the woman has left human waste in front of her property about seven times in recent weeks, even though there are public toilets nearby.
She says her children caught the runner in the act, squatting by their house in Colorado Springs.
The city police department said such behaviour is "bizarre".
Lt Howard Black told the BBC the suspect could be charged under a city ordinance banning public urination or defecation.
"I haven't come across anything like this in 35 years with the police department," he added.
He said it is not clear if mental health issues are involved.

Mrs Budde told news station KKTV she has confronted the woman.
"So I come outside, and I'm like, 'Are you serious?' Are you really taking a poop right here in front of my kids?' She's like, 'Yeah, sorry!'
"I thought for sure she's mortified, it's an accident, she'll go get a dog bag, clean it up and never run here again. Not the case."
Mrs Budde added: "Two other times we've caught her - caught her yesterday - she changed up her time a little bit because she knew I was watching.
"I put a sign on the wall that's like, 'please, I'm begging you, please stop.'"
But she says this did not deter the jogger from answering the call of nature outside the Budde residence.
